abstract = {We present a number of recent evaluations of direct bonding, a glueless bonding technology, performed under ambient conditions. If combined with bond-strengthening, this geometry-conserving technology is well suited for an application in far ultraviolet immersion lithography. Our term beyond direct bonding refers to taking at least one additional technological step beyond direct bonding, involving chemical interface engineering, advanced silicon-on-insulator(SOI) technology, whereby the unwanted influence of dilatation mismatch is obviated.The combination of successive direct bonding, nanopillar lattice structures and silicon-technological engineering makes it possible for us to arrange quantum dots, wires,and planes in a transversal cascade. We also address the interrelationship between direct bonding and elasticity, as well as plasticity; the latter is in relation to direct bonded glass wafers that are thermally treated to create the geometric shape, e.g.,required for specific lab-on-a-chip components with a three-dimensional overall configuration.},

abstract = {The optical response of coherent thin-film multilayers is often represented with Fresnel coefficients in a 2 {\texttimes} 2 matrix configuration. Here the usual transfer matrix was modified to a generic form, with the ability to use the absolute squares of the Fresnel coefficients, so as to include incoherent (thick layers) and partially coherent (rough surface or interfaces) reflection and transmission. The method is integrated by use of models for refractive-index depth profiling. The utility of the method is illustrated with various multilayer structures formed by ion implantation into Si, including buried insulating and conducting layers, and multilayers with a thick incoherent layer in an arbitrary position.},
