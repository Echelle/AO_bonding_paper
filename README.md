### Compiling

Basically, you will need to mimic my directory structure for all this to work.  For now I have everything that is static in the .gitignore file.  Just type:

`Make`

### Figures and source code

Most of the Figures were made in IPython Notebooks.  Look for them in the `notebooks` directory.
